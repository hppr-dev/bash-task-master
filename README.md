Bash Task Master
===================
Bash Task Master enhances bash by providing a way to create context for directories within project.

Features:

  - Centralized -- Tasks can be run in any folder under your home directory without adding them to your path

  - Parsed and Validated Input -- Easily access named command line arguments

  - Scoped -- Different tasks are loaded depending on the current working directory

  - Isolated -- Environment variables aren't affected (unless you want them to be)


Bash Task Master was designed with flexibility and expandibility in mind.

 - GNU Awk 4.1.3
 - GNU sed 4.2.2
 - GNU bash 4.3.42

Bash Task Master was tested using these versions. It is likely that it works on other versions as well.
